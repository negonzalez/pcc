Module providing class to handle mapping of FITS keywords into

class PccUtDb2KeyMap:
    """
    Handles mapping of DB columns into FITS keywords and
    vice versa.

    The mapping is based on a DB To Key Mapping File (DB2KMAP) which is a
    PAF file and has the following format, example::

     DBKMAP.TABLE    isaac_all
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   lst:LST
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   tpl_expno:TPL.EXPNO
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   ins_filt1_name:INS.FILT1.NAME
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   ins_lamp1_name:INS.LAMP1.NAME

     DBKMAP.TABLE    uves
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   ins_temp1_mean:INS.TEMP1.MEAN
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   det_win1_nx:DET.WIN1.NX
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   tel_az:TEL.AZ
    
     DBKMAP.TABLE    fors
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   ins_coll_name:INS.COLL.NAME
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   det_read_clock:DET.READ.CLOCK
     DBKMAP.ATTRIB   dimm_fwhm_avg:DIMM.FWHM.AVG 

     # --- oOo ---

    The DB2KMAP can be perceived as consisting of blocks, with mappings
    for different tables. The keyword "DBKMAP.TABLE" indicates the start
    of such a block, and contains the name of the table. The keywords
    "DBKMAP.ATTRIB" are used to indicate the mapping between the column
    names and the corresponding FITS keyword (written in the Short-FITS
    format). The value of this keyword consist of two fields separated
    with colon: "<column name>:<keyword>".


    **Mapping from DB -> FITS Keywords:** 

    This mapping is done with the method PccUtDb2KeyMap.db2Key(). It takes
    the DB2KMAP file as input parameter, and generates a list of PccKey
    objects, to which a reference is returned.


    **Mapping from FITS/PAF -> DB:**
    
    The mapping from a list of PccKey objects into the DB is done with the
    method PccUtDb2KeyMap.key2Db(). The mapping of keys contained in
    FITS files or in PAF files are done with PccUtDb2KeyMap.key2DbFits()
    and PccUtDb2KeyMap.key2DbPaf().

    _THE MAPPING FROM FITS/PAF TO THE DB IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED._
